**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

This quarter, the most fascinating topic I've explored is the general workflow of intelligent agents, especially how diverse system components collaborate seamlessly. From large language models executing tasks and parsing instructions, through external calls to a Neo4j database, to a LangGraph agent orchestrating the overall workflow, it's been eye-opening to see how these moving parts work together. Understanding the integration between AI-driven processing and knowledge graph databases has really elevated my appreciation for modular design in agent-based systems.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  

I'm considering an investigation focused on building an interactive learning tool for medical students. Rather than relying exclusively on memorizing textbook information, this project would allow students to meaningfully explore relationships between biomedical concepts using a knowledge graph interface. The core idea is to leverage agents and databases to support active exploration, contextual learning, and inquiry—transforming rote memorization into relational understanding that supports long-term retention and critical thinking.


**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  

Reflecting on my current project, I think I bit off a bit more than I could chew with the initial scope. For a future iteration, I would consider narrowing the focus—perhaps limiting the number of external integrations or domains represented in the knowledge graph. This would allow for a deeper dive into optimizing specific system aspects and help ensure deliverables remain realistic and achievable within the allotted timeframe.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  

Going forward, I would like to incorporate additional structured data sources into the database, enhancing both the agent's context and breadth of reasoning. Moreover, I plan to more thoroughly evaluate results using appropriate user studies and statistical tests, focusing on measures like usability, comprehension, retention, and trust. This empirical approach will help validate that the system truly meets user and domain needs.
